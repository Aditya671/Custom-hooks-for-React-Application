   This repository contains some of the hooks i developed while exploring reactjs as a frontend developer.
   
   *[What w3School say about React Custom Hooks](https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_customhooks.asp)*
   Hooks are reusable functions. When you have component logic that needs to be used by multiple components, we can extract that logic to a custom Hook. Custom Hooks start with "use".

   ***The need for Custom Hooks:*** *The main reason for which you should be using Custom hooks is to maintain the concept of DRY(Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) in your React apps*

   **Custom Hooks:**
   These hooks require ReactJs framework as a Prerequisite and can be used with any reactjs version made after v16.8.
   The Custom Hooks are as follows:
   1. useBrowserLocation
   2. useComponentDimensions
   3. useFetch
   4. useHttp
   5. useKeyPressObserver
   6. useUnsavedExitPrompt
   7. useViewPort
   8. useSpeechRecognizer
   9. useTextToSpeech
